  2. **TCP/IP** â€“ how the browser connects to the server using the IP and port 443  
  3. **Firewall** â€“ how traffic passes through firewalls  
  4. **HTTPS/SSL** â€“ how the SSL/TLS handshake encrypts traffic  
  5. **Load-balancer** â€“ how the request is distributed across servers  
  6. **Web server** â€“ how it serves static content or forwards to the app server  
  7. **Application server** â€“ how it executes application logic  
  8. **Database** â€“ how data is queried and returned  

- Publish your blog post on **Medium** or **LinkedIn**.  
- Share the URL of your blog post in:

  - That traffic is **encrypted**  
  - That traffic goes through a **firewall**  
  - The request is distributed via a **load balancer**  
  - The **web server** serving the web page  
  - The **application server** generating the page  
  - The **application server** querying the **database**  

- Tools you can use: **Gliffy**, **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or any equivalent.  

- Share the URL of your diagram image in:
  - The answer file `1-what_happen_when_diagram`  
  - The submission field
